# 3. Create and Test Domain.jl

To get experience with Julia and modules, we will build an application where we can register and retrieve persons.

You start with creating the sub-module file Domain.jl. Then you define in Domain.jl:
- the objects Address and Person.
- the enumerator AddressType with the values EMAIL and WORK.
- the local function create_key, which will create a unique key based on the time of creation and address.
- the objects that are accessible by other modules.

Finally, you define the test code in the file runtests.jl.

Pages = ["chapter3.md"]
```

## Domain.jl - Domain Objects

On the Domain page, you define the custom data structures that make-up your domain.

To define a data structure and type, use the keyword `struct`. The body consists of the fields of the data structure. A struct is a non-mutable object unless you precede it with the keyword `mutable`.

Use constructors to define standard values. It simplifies the creating of an object.

```julia
module Domain #1

using Dates #2

export Person, Address, AddressType, EMAIL, WORK #3

# local function to generate an unique id
create_key(name::String) = string(hash(name * string(time()))) #4

# enumerated type for an address.
@enum AddressType EMAIL WORK #5

struct Address #6
  id::String
  created::DateTime
  address_type::AddressType
  address::String
  #constructors
  Address(address_type, address) = new(create_key(address), now(), address_type, address)
end # Address

struct Person #7
  id::String
  created::DateTime
  name::String
  addresses::Array{Address, 1}
  #constructors
  Person(name) = new(create_key(name), name, [])
  Person(name, addresses) = new(create_key(name), now(), name, addresses)
end # Person

end

```
\#1 Module names start with a capital letter. See the [Blue: a Style Guide for Julia](https://github.com/invenia/BlueStyle).

\#2 If you need date functions like time(), date(), or now() you have to load the Dates package.

\#3 With the keyword `export` you define what elements are default available to users.

\#4 We use the hash function to generate a unique id. You use `*` to concatenate Strings in Julia. The function `string` converts the date-time value to a String value.

\#5 The AddressTypes that you allow in an Address object.

\#6 The structure of the `Address` datatype. The constructor `Address(address_type, address)` allows the user to only specify the AddressType and the address. The values for the fields `id` and `created` are generated by the Julia code.

\#7 The Person datatype. The values for the fields `id` and `created` are generated by Julia code. When you don't specify an address, the software creates an empty array. Later on, you can add addresses using the `push!` function.


## Activity 3.1: Create the File Domain.jl in the src-Folder

One of the parts of the Onion architecture is the Domain, materialized in the file Domain.jl. The Domain only communicates with Julia or Julia modules or packages.

##### Prerequisites (activities of chapter 2)
- Activity 2.1: Setup the Development Environment.
- Activity 2.2: Create the Accounts module.
- Activity 2.3: Create a Repository on GitHub.

In this activity you: will:
- Create the file Domain.jl.

---

| Step | Action | Comment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Go to the `~/.julia/dev/Accounts` folder|  |
| 2 | $ code .  | Start VSCode. |
| 3 | Right click on: src |  |
| 4 | Select: `New file` |  |
| 5| Type: Domain.jl | A file that represents a module starts with a capital letter.  |
| 6 | Press: <Enter> | A new document appears in the pane next to the navigation pane. |
||

In the navigation pane you see the next files in the folder src:

```
v Accounts
  v src
    - Accounts.jl
    - Domain.jl
```

## Activity 3.2: Pasting the Domain Code into Domain.jl

We define the Domain as a Julia sub-module. In a module, you declare the export and import items.

Export items are items that are used by other modules and Julia programs. An item can be an object (struct) or a function.

Import items are the items that you use from other modules like the `Dates` module of Julia. Later on, you will learn how to declare this kind of dependencies in the file Project.toml.

If you don't change the names and their types, you could consider the module as an interface. The advantage is that you can change the implementation of an item without affecting other external parts.

##### Prerequisites
- [The previous activity 3.1](#Activity-3.1:-Create-the-File-Domain.jl-in-the-src-Folder)

In this activity you will:
- Add the Domain example code to the file Domain.jl.
- Save the file.

---

| Step | Action | Comment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Select the code from the section [Domain.jl-Domain-objects](#Domain.jl-Domain-Objects-1) |  |
| 2 | Ctrl-C | Copy the code to the clipboard. |
| 3 | Paste the code in the file Domain.jl |  |
| 4 | Ctrl-S | Save the file. |
||


## Modified Accounts.jl

```julia
module Accounts

include("Domain.jl"); using .Domain #1

end
```
\#1 the function `include` loads the code of the specified file. `using .Domain` activates the module.
The dot refers to a sub-module of Accounts. The `;` separates the two Julia statements.

## Activity 3.3: Update Accounts.jl

The sub-modules that you create are listed and instantiated in the main-module Accounts.jl.

##### Prerequisites
- [The previous activity 3.2](#Activity-3.2:-Pasting-the-Domain-Code-into-Domain.jl)

In this activity you will:
- Declare Domain as a sub-module of Accounts in Accounts.jl.

---

| Step | Action | Comment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Open file:  `Accounts.jl` |  |
| 2 | Delete all lines |  |
| 3 | Copy the code [Modified Accounts.jl](#Modified-Accounts.jl-1) into the file |  |
| 4 | Ctrl-S | Save the file. |
||


## Dependencies

You declare all dependencies of your module in the file `Project.toml` under the section `[deps]`. The `now()`-function belongs to `Dates` module. Dates is a Julia module and you load with `using Dates`.

```julia
name = "Accounts"
uuid = "a1b4bf14-7ec5-4e42-8992-fb1d0e08b0e4"
authors = ["Rob Bontekoe <rbontekoe@appligate.nl> and contributors"]
version = "0.1.0"

[deps]
Dates = "ade2ca70-3891-5945-98fb-dc099432e06a"

[compat]
julia = "1"

[extras]
Test = "8dfed614-e22c-5e08-85e1-65c5234f0b40"

[targets]
test = ["Test"]
```

## Activity 3.4: Adding Dates as Dependency

You define dependencies on other packages in the file Project.toml. If you are in your local area and you add a package, Julia will do it for you. If the file Project.toml does not exist, Julia will create it for you.

##### Prerequisites
- [The previous activity 3.3](#Activity-3.3:-Update-Accounts.jl)

In this activity you will:
- Activate the `Accounts` environment.
- Add the dependency `Dates` to the environment.
- Inspect the status of the active environment.
